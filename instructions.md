## QR Code Generator Project - React and Custom Hooks

This week, you will dive into a project that involves generating QR codes using React and a custom hook. The QR Code Generator Demo project is a simple yet effective tool that allows users to input a URL, generate a QR code from it, and download the generated code as an image. Your mission is to understand the existing codebase and potentially expand upon it, ensuring that the application is user-friendly and robust.

### Context:

This project is a fantastic opportunity to explore the capabilities of React and custom hooks. The existing codebase provides a solid foundation, and your task is to ensure that the application is polished, potentially adding any additional features or improvements that you identify.

- Attention to Detail: Ensure that the application is user-friendly and that any additional features are implemented thoughtfully.
- Be Honest: If there are aspects of the project that you find challenging or are unable to implement, communicate this transparently.
- Explore: Feel free to explore additional libraries or tools that could enhance the project.

### Core Functionality:

- URL Input: Users should be able to input a URL that will be converted into a QR code.
- QR Code Generation: Upon input, a QR code should be generated from the URL.
- Download: Users should have the ability to download the generated QR code as an image file.
- Repeat: Users should be able to generate a new QR code after one has been created.

### Requirements:

- React: The app should be built with React.
- Custom Hook: Utilize the `useQRCodeGenerator` custom hook to manage the QR code generation logic.
- User-Friendly UI: Ensure that the UI is intuitive and user-friendly.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues during QR code generation.
- Responsive: Ensure that the app is responsive and provides a solid user experience on various screen sizes.

### Code Insights:

- useQRCodeGenerator Hook: This custom hook manages the logic for generating and downloading QR codes. It manages the state for the input URL, the generated QR code data, and the visibility of the input element. It exposes methods for generating the QR code, downloading it, and resetting the state to generate a new code. Explore the [useQRCodeGenerator.jsx](https://github.com/Technigo/qr-code-generator-demo/blob/main/src/hooks/useQRCodeGenerator.jsx) file for detailed insights.
- App Component: This component serves as the UI for the application, utilizing the `useQRCodeGenerator` hook to manage the QR code generation process. It conditionally renders UI elements based on the state and provides functionality for inputting URLs, generating QR codes, and downloading them. Dive into the [App.jsx](https://github.com/Technigo/qr-code-generator-demo/blob/main/src/App.jsx) file to understand its structure and functionality.

### Design Recommendations

You'll be handed a design from a fellow UX student at Technigo. It's important to stick to this design when you're building your project. If you're looking for an easy way to style your React project, give styled-components or tailwindCSS a try. They're both great tools that can help you bring the design to life without a lot of fuss.

Happy coding!
